THREAD :thread: matrova breeze review

the matrova breeze is a smooth speed pad with higher static friction compared to other speed clothpads whilst retaining the low dynamic friction


pros:
a lot smoother than artisan raiden, satin like feeling

a little softer than artisan mid, which feels great

very smooth glide while in motion


cons:
may cause micro errors in directional changes during precise tracking

may feel inconsistent compared to the raiden due to the large delta between dynamic and static friction

got quite affected by humidity, causing the static friction to dramatically increase, leaving a slight muddy feeling to the start and end of movements


observations:
feels really good for dynamic clicking due to the higher static friction and slightly softer than mid base providing some extra stopping power whilst retaining quick micros from the low dynamic friction

feels a little inconsistent for static

seems to be really good for tracking larger targets with longer strafes, whilst being a little harder to pilot for shorter strafe patterns or smaller targets with lower movement speeds

found it to be a little more tricky to use in real ingame scenarios than other pads from the matrova line up, probably due to the large delta in static and dynamic friction

it is overall a good pad for aimtraining, a great pad for dynamic clicking, but seems a bit harder to use ingame due it having very specific characteristics
