:thread: matrova shadow hunt review THREAD :thread:

matrova was kind enough to send out a second set of pads for review, this will of course not impact my review or opinions regarding their products

pros
smooth surface
a little firmer than artisans xsoft
makes initial flicks very accurate
great for tac shooters and low sens

cons
steep learning curve unless you really know what youre looking for
the logo does not look nice at all (they're working on a new one)
simply not a pad to do any tracking on at all

observations
gets less sluggish with dots compared to full size skates

changes the tension required through out a flick drastically, needing to through put more force for a longer duration when flicking, this may cause fatigue faster and make tension management difficult

the dynamic and static frictions seem to be quite close in delta

would not describe the pad as muddy but rather more of a dragging feeling

doing anything above 50cm gets difficult as the pad never really lets you go

feels great at anything static or tac shooter related at 60cm>
