matrova balance X review thread

this is the last pad i will be reviewing form the matrova line up for the forseeable future.

the balance X is a balanced pad with a bit more texture that is reminiscent of the artisan zero.

i believe this is matrovas best balance pad as it truely lives up to the concept of an all round good tool for any context.



pros

decent surface feedback
no muddy feeling
good for a large range of scenarios/games


cons

does not feel that good without a sleeve compared to other pads from the line up (breeze, shadowhunt, scarlet)



performance

the balance X ticks all of the boxes required for a balance pad, as it does not really fall closer into a control pad archetype, it stays true to the name by being very good for both dynamic and static clicking, whilst retaining more than decent enough performance for tracking regardless of if its precision or reactive. 

i find this pad to also be very good on any sens, most likely due to the lack of a muddy feeling which would usually cause jitters on higher sens.

directional changes and continuous motions for tracking do not feel sluggish in anyway, landings for flick based scenarios/games feel quite good aswell due to the pad not having too much static friction which may otherwise cause the landings to feel like theyre locked into place after stopping and killing the momentum. this is highly beneficial for different types of target switching.



closing thoughts

i think the balance X is what a balanced pad should be by definition, it does everything well but nothing exceptionally great.

using dots will give an even quicker experience, drastically reducing the static friction without reducing the dynamic friction too much.
